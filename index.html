      <p>
        Golden Guitars was brought to life by long time friends, B.J. Golden and Eric Breish. The two friends met in Texas in the early 2000's while working with a local band. Shortly after they met, B.J. went down the path of lutherie and music performance, studying lutherie at Vermont Instruments as well as earning a bachelors and masters degree in classical guitar performance. after graduate school, B.J. joined the band of multi-platinum country recording artist, Brantley Gilbert, in 2014. Eric, a former U.S. Marine and Full Sail graduate, studied with the world renowned visual artist, Andreas Nottebohm. <br><br>
        
        B.J. was always fascinated with the art that Andreas and Eric made and he eventually got a piece of his own from Eric in 2010. After having the art piece hanging on his wall for a while, B.J. imagined what he would have commissioned from Eric had he not been in graduate school. The first idea that came to mind was to have a guitar of some kind mounted on Eric's artwork, joining his passion for guitar and visual art. After spending a few years on the road touring with Brantley, B.J. gave Eric a call one day and asked him what he thought about incorporating his art on the face of a guitar. Eric, who is also a guitar player and musician, as well as an audio engineer, was all in on the idea. <br><br>
        
        Seeing Eric's art in person really makes an impact on the viewer. The visual depth of his work is stunning and the thought of seeing that depth and visual movement on the face of a guitar was enough to get the two friends rolling on the idea. The problem they faced was maintaining the individual integrity of a fine instrument and a work of art and blending the two into one masterful concept. It turned out better than the two friends could have anticipated. The first face plates Eric created looked incredible on a guitar body. And that is when the full concept of Golden Guitars was born. B.J. had Eric stand back as he held up the newly created guitar in front of an existing art work in Eric's studio. The visual result was breathtaking. Each work held its own sense of depth and movement, but if the guitar was mounted on the art work, it would create a playable work of art unlike anything the world had ever seen.<br><br>
        
        The initial prototypes were built on telecaster bodies just to see if the idea was feasible. B.J. brought in Jared Peterman, who works as a guitar tech in the Brantley Gilbert camp, to help design and build the guitar prototypes. With the success of the first two guitars and seeing how great the guitars looked in stage lighting as well as displayed works of art, B.J., Eric, and Jared started designing their own guitar. Over the next few years, the guitar prototypes were refined and the first production work was created with a backing art piece.<br><br>

        Golden Guitars redefines what makes an instrument a work of art. Each instrument and accompanying art work is unique and of the highest quality. The instruments compete with the finest guitars on the market, but with an unparelled visual aspect.
