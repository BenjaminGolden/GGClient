        Golden Guitars was brought to life by long time friends, B.J. Golden and Eric Breish. The two friends met in Texas in the early 2000's while working with a local band. Shortly after they met, B.J. went down the path of lutherie and music performance, studying lutherie at Vermont Instruments as well as earning a bachelors and masters degree in classical guitar performance. after graduate schoole, B.J. joined the band of multi-platinum recording artist, Brantley Gilbert, in 2014. Eric, a former U.S. Marine and Full Sail graduate, studied with the world renowned visual artist, Andreas Nottebohm. <br><br>
        
        B.J. was always facinated with the art that Andreas and Eric made and he eventually got a piece of his own from Eric in 2010. After having the art piece hanging on his wall for a while, B.J. imagined what he would have commisioned from Eric had he not been in graduate school. The first idea that came to mind was to have a guitar of some kind mounted on Eric's artwork, joining his passion for guitar and visual art. After spending a few years on the road touring with Brantley, B.J. gave Eric a call one day and asked him what he thought about incorporating his art on the face of a guitar. Eric, who is also a guitar player and musician, as well as an audio engineer, was all in on the idea. <br><br>
        
        Seeing Eric's art in person really makes an impact on you. The visual depth of his work is stunning and the thought of seeing that depth and visual movement on the face of a guitar was enough to get the two rolling on the idea. The problem the two friends faced was finding out if it would be possible to combine a high-end professional instrument with Eric's unique visual art to create a playable work of art? It turned out better than the two friends could have inticipated. <br><br>
        
        The initial prototypes were built on telecaster bodies just to see if the idea was feasible. B.J. brought in Jared Peterman, who works as a guitar tech in the Brantley Gilbert camp, to help design and build the guitar prototypes. With the success of the first two guitars and seeing how great the guitars looked in stage lighting as well as displayed works of art, B.J., Eric, and Jared started designing their own guitar. Bet
